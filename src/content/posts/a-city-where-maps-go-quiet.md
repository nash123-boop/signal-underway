**Opening signal:** The numbers don’t match the story. If this were a normal city build-out, the permits, suppliers, and logistics would leave a loud trail.

But this one stays strangely quiet.

## The trace
- Procurement activity appears **clustered** and **repeating** across adjacent jurisdictions.
- Contractors rotate between projects that look unrelated on paper.
- The logistics pattern suggests **staging**, not serving residents.

## What it could mean
If you assume the build isn't for civilians, the pieces start fitting:
- Redundancy becomes the goal.
- Access control becomes the feature.
- "Empty" becomes strategic.

## The part no one answers
If this is a city, who is it for — and why does it prefer being unlisted?
