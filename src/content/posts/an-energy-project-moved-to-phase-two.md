The first phase always sounds like a pilot.

The second phase is where you discover what it was really for.

## The trace
Look for:
- Step-change in procurement scale
- New contractors with defense-adjacent portfolios
- Sudden emphasis on resilience and redundancy

## What it implies
If the objective is **continuity under stress**, the architecture makes sense:
- multiple inputs
- multiple outputs
- fewer single points of failure

## The uneasy ending
If this grid is being built to survive something, what scenario are they designing for?
